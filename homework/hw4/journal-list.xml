                                            published by undergraduates at The University of Chicago
                                            that aims to provide a forum for problem-solving and
                                            analysis around international affairs. The journal,
                                            founded in 2012, features a collection of articles that
                                            reflect on historical, economic, political, and cultural
                                            developments within nations other than the United
                                            States, or explores relationships between the United
                                            States and the world. Each edition covers topics from
                                            regions around the world, and engages in ongoing
                                            discussions held on the international stage. Our
                                            biannual edition, published in the early winter and late
                                            spring, serves as a complement to our regularly updated
                                            online publication, featuring articles, op-eds, and blog

                                            peer-reviewed, professional-level, open-access, academic
                                            publication that is committed to publishing manuscripts
                                            of the highest scholarship resulting from significant
                                            scientific research or outstanding scientific analysis.
                                            Each paper published in the CUSJ undergoes a
                                            double-blind peer-review process facilitated by the
                                            journal's Editorial Review Board and a faculty review by
                                            a member of the Faculty Advisory Board. The CUSJ has two
                                            primary goals. First, the CUSJ aims to (1) publish works
                                            of the highest scholarship authored primarily by
                                            undergraduates. Second, the CUSJ aims to (2) educate
                                            students about the academic publication process, both
                                            from the inside as a member of the CUSJ staff and from
                                            the outside as a submitter to a scientific journal with
                                            academic standards that are as rigorous as any
                                            professional-level scientific publication. </p>

                                            comparative historical analysis, or other methodological

                                            interdisciplinary dialogue on sustainable development.
                                            This journal aims to bring students, researchers,
                                            professors, and practitioners from a variety of
                                            disciplines and geographical regions in direct
                                            conversation with each other through an online,
                                            academically rigorous medium. Consilience publishes
                                            scholarly articles, opinion pieces, field notes,
                                            editorial columns, and photo essays. By providing a
                                            public platform for discussion, we hope to encourage a
                                            global community to think more broadly, thoroughly, and
                                            analytically about sustainable development. The journal
                                            is run by a team of undergraduate and graduate students,
                                            under the guidance of faculty from Columbia University

                                        <p>Corrupted Files is a non-hierarchical journal of research
                                            by students at all levels of study (Levels 4-7) and
                                            staff at Ravensbourne, as well as that of external
                                            contributors. The journal was initiated by Contextual
                                            Studies at Ravensbourne, with Dr Sara Andersdotter as
                                            its Editor. Corrupted Files is thematic, open access,
                                            and published annually in both online and hardcopy
                                            formats. Its aim is to serve as a platform through which
                                            undergraduate work is shared as research, sitting
                                            alongside the research of more experienced academics and
                                            practitioners. The journal thus plays a crucial part in
                                            a strategic drive towards the support and dissemination
                                            of undergraduate research, and the creation of a more
                                            inclusive research culture.</p>

                                        <p>Elements was founded in September 2004 by a group of 20
                                            undergraduate students. The journal published its first
                                            issue in May 2005, featuring research articles written
                                            by Boston College undergraduates along with shorter
                                            special features. The goal of the publication is to
                                            become a forum for the exchange of original ideas within
                                            and across disciplines at the university.</p>

                                            area. Articles are submitted in a two-stage process:
                                            first, proposals for articles are reviewed by
                                            faculty-student teams; second, the resulting full-length
                                            articles undergo a second round of peer review.
                                            Acceptance to the journal is competitive—only 10-20
                                            percent of submitted proposals are accepted. Recently
                                            published articles have been from a wide range of

                                        <p>The George Mason Review is a cross-disciplinary
                                            undergraduate journal. Through the publication of
                                            exemplary, scholarly works, the GMR acts as a medium for
                                            discussion among us--the Mason undergraduate body--about
                                            scholarship. It seeks to re-vision scholarship by
                                            exploring and challenging the boundaries separating
                                            disciplines from each other, the humanities from the
                                            sciences, and academic from creative. In doing so, the
                                            GMR hopes to represent the academic excellence of the
                                            Mason undergraduate body.</p>

                                            can uncover science and discover all that it can do.

                                            The Journal of Interpersonal Relations, Intergroup
                                            Relations and Identity (JIRIRI) is a social psychology
                                            journal with the goal of promoting the creation and
                                            expression of novel theoretical and empirical ideas.
                                            Created at Université de Montréal, it is an
                                            international scientific peer-reviewed journal for
                                            undergraduate students. The JIRIRI’s goal is to promote
                                            creative and original ideas in social psychology and
                                            related fields, produced by undergraduate students
                                            worldwide. Undergraduate students are given the
                                            opportunity to either publish an empirical or
                                            theoretical manuscript, to review scientific manuscripts
                                            or to become part of the editorial team. The JIRIRI’s
                                            next goal is to diffuse its material to other professors
                                            and students that wish to use the peer-review process as
                                            a teaching tool. </p>

                                            undergraduate students. We are continuously seeking
                                            quality manuscripts for publication and will consider
                                            manuscripts in any area of psychology. Although MPS

                                            to foster scholarly discourse on topical and historical
                                            issues pertaining to law or the legal system. In this
                                            spirit, the journal's principal objective is to publish
                                            exceptional undergraduate works, drawn from an array of
                                            disciplinary perspectives, that evaluate and elucidate
                                            the intricacies, vagaries, and nuances of law as they
                                            relate to domestic and international affairs, business,
                                            academia, and society. PULJ aims to sustain and enrich a
                                            vibrant discussion about law at the undergraduate level
                                            because it recognizes that the student writers of today
                                            will be the leaders, lawyers, and scholars of tomorrow.

                                            Scholarship provides a space for undergraduate writers
                                            to share their work outside of the context and
                                            constraints of the college classroom. Each issue of
                                            Process centers on a topic of contemporary interest to a
                                            global audience, fostering critical conversations that
                                            transverse disciplinary, cultural, and national borders.
                                            We believe that undergraduate writing deserves serious
                                            attention, and hope to encourage writers to begin
                                            forging new pathways for the future of academic and
                                            public scholarship.</p>

                                            each year by the Writing Program at Illinois State
                                            University. The print issue of each journal is used as a
                                            primary text in two of ISU's undergraduate general
                                            education writing courses. Digital versions of previous
                                            issues are available online. The title of the journal
                                            reflects our aspirations—to present writing research by
                                            different authors and in a wide range of different
                                            topics, forms, and media. The journal solicits authors
                                            from within and outside of our institutions and other
                                            academic institutions. We've published faculty, graduate
                                            students, undergraduates, high school students, and
                                            nonstudents-- all Writing researchers. We encourage
                                            authors to share not only what they’ve learned about
                                            writing but also how they learned it. Thus, each new
                                            volume brings together a diverse collection of articles
                                            that all enact some form of writing research from a
                                            variety of authors. Authors can learn more about
                                            publishing on our websites, which offer both back issues
                                            of the journal and a range of different guides for
                                            researching and writing for the journal.</p>

                                        <p>The International Journal for Undergraduate Research -
                                            Science, Engineering &amp; Technology (IJUR-SET) is a
                                            peer-reviewed journal for undergraduate work of the
                                            highest caliber. Its goals are to add to the body of
                                            knowledge in science and technology fields and to
                                            showcase the outstanding research activities of
                                            undergraduates. It provides a forum for students to
                                            publicly share their research, offering opportunities
                                            for exposing their work to potential graduate programs
                                            and employers. The journal accepts individual and
                                            collaborative research reports, formally written by the
                                            undergraduate students. Faculty-mentored research papers
                                            will also be considered. Any undergraduate student may
                                            submit work to this journal, and to be eligible for
                                            publication, the research must be faculty mentored.
                                            Submissions are accepted at any time. The Journal
                                            publishes twice a year (February and September).</p>

                                        <p>The Measure: A Journal of Undergraduate Research is a
                                            refereed journal dedicated to publishing undergraduate
                                            research from courses in the College of Humanities and
                                            Social Sciences at Sam Houston State University.
                                            Students enrolled in a CHSS course during the academic
                                            year are eligible to submit their work for publication

                                            of the disciplines in the college. The Measure is guided
                                            by these central principles: undergraduate research is a
                                            vital component of higher education; students enhance
                                            their education when they engage in original research to
                                            make an intellectual contribution to the discipline;
                                            research shared with a broader audience enhances
                                            learning outcomes; and faculty members contribute to
                                            society when they involve undergraduates in research
                                            opportunities.</p>

                                            Undergraduate Writing Program at Columbia University. It
                                            features exemplary essays written by first-year
                                            undergraduates in the Core Curriculum course, University
                                            Writing. Hundreds of students voluntarily submit their
                                            essays to TMR for possible publication and approximately
                                            ten are chosen each year by an editorial advisory board
                                            made up of University Writing instructors. Since these
                                            essays serve as vivid examples of peer work, they are
                                            commonly assigned in University Writing. Students may be
                                            prompted by their instructors to identify the rhetorical
                                            strategies employed in an essay, contemplate their
                                            effectiveness, and attempt to emulate those they admire

                                            is an annual journal that showcases the best and most
                                            original research in psychology conducted by

                                            research in all areas of psychology, including clinical,
                                            developmental, cognitive, and social psychology. Their
                                            goal is to contribute to the scientific advance by
                                            encouraging serious, quality research early in students'
                                            academic careers. We provide a platform for
                                            undergraduate scientists to share their findings, and
                                            aim to bring together a community of young psychologists
                                            from both the United States and abroad. </p>

                                        <p>With the help of Fairfield University’s International
                                            Studies Program, four undergraduate students established
                                            the Undergraduate Journal of Global Citizenship in 2010.
                                            The journal was part of an AAC&amp;U Bringing Theory to
                                            Practice grant to promote responsible global citizenship
                                            and student development. The journal is designed to
                                            highlight the accomplishments of young minds in constant
                                            intellectual engagement with their surroundings. The
                                            Undergraduate Journal of Global Citizenship honors the
                                            work of undergraduates from diverse academic
                                            backgrounds, united by their dedication to global
                                            citizenship and social responsibility, in line with the
                                            Jesuit values of the university. Welcomed are
                                            undergraduate submissions that showcase and promote the
                                            understanding of global citizenship and social
                                            responsibility. We view global citizenship as a
                                            disengagement from barriers into a recognition and
                                            understanding of human actions with social, political,
                                            environmental, and/or economic impact worldwide. A sense
                                            of community, not only with our direct neighbors but
                                            also with societies and lives around the globe, makes a
                                            socially responsible individual. </p>

                                        <p>The Undergraduate Journal of Humanistic Studies (UJHS) is
                                            a peer-reviewed academic journal that promotes
                                            undergraduate research in the humanities and social
                                            sciences at Carleton College. Our goal is to present
                                            papers that bring to light new narratives and fresh
                                            points of view. Highlighting work that challenges
                                            dominant perspectives, the UJHS serves as a forum for
                                            contributors and readers to reconsider their position
                                            within the context of their society. In the spirit of
                                            the liberal arts, the UJHS is a multidisciplinary
                                            journal that accepts submissions from a broad range of
                                            subjects, demonstrating how student research can
                                            contribute to a variety of fields.</p>

                                            majors. In particular, its purpose is to disseminate
                                            selected applied mathematics projects of engineering and
                                            science students. A unique feature of this journal, as
                                            shown by its title, is that each student whose work is
                                            published has been advised by at least two different
                                            people: a subject area advisor (who typically, but not
                                            always, suggested the problem) and a mathematics

                                            (UJTR) is an open-access, peer-reviewed journal designed
                                            to acknowledge the achievements of LSUA undergraduates
                                            in all areas of teaching and research. While
                                            undergraduate teaching and research are the main focus,
                                            research from faculty members is also encouraged for
                                            submission. While we primarily accept publications
                                            within the LSUA community, we also welcome submissions
                                            outside of LSUA.</p>

                                            only journal of history at Vanderbilt. The publication
                                            seeks to show the importance of studying the past
                                            through its semiannual publication of historical
                                            research. Topics may cover a wide range of disciplines,
                                            including economics, politics, anthropology, and more.

                                            which historically accurate, interesting, and creative
                                            articles are critiqued. Undergraduate students at any
                                            university are encouraged to submit their work. The
                                            journal provides a forum of academic debate over
                                            relevant historical questions.</p>
