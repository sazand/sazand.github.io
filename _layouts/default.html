Currently, he is a Master's degree student in Library Science at Indiana University Bloomington. There he follows dual specializations of Rare Books and Manuscripts and Digital Humanities. In addition, as a librarian, he is interested in Textual Encoding Initiative for manuscripts description, transcription, and cataloging. Previously he has been a visiting scholar at IUB, Boston University, and the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Sassan also holds a B.Sc. in chemistry and possesses several years of related field experience, having worked as an assistant in the Isfahan Department of Environmentâ€™s laboratory of water and wastewater from 1995 to 2007. There, he tested various measures of water quality such as BOD, COD, DO, and water hardness; my work included both classical methods (e.g., Kjeldahl digestion) and spectroscopy. He also has extensive experience working with scientific sources such as abstracts, journals, books, and software for chemistry (environmental chemistry in particular) at both undergraduate and graduate levels. In addition, he taught for some years in Iran.</a></l
